## 0.5.7 (HUD build, wesleyredhat)

HUD support, contributed by [eroobeeroo](https://github.com/eroobeeroo). On Robert's 0.5.7 (waze-on-cluster 0.8.7,
cluster-render 0.3.11).

- **Show map on**: one button cycles the map between the cluster, the HUD and both at once (Cluster + HUD);
  the map moves at once and the choice is kept for the next start.
- **HUD map size**: Standard (the fitted box, about 57 % of the HUD's width),
  70 %, 85 % (the widest: wider is cut off at the HUD's edges) and 40 %,
  resized at once and kept. Enabled while the map goes to the HUD.
- On the HUD the map's frames are scaled on the head unit to the size they are
  shown at (sharper, 2-6x less data to the KOMBI), its corners are rounded, and
  a night map's background is made black - which the HUD shows as nothing - so
  only the roads, route and labels float there (green, such as parks, is kept).
  Works for Waze and Google Maps.
- The HUD map steps aside while the HUD's media and list pop-ups show, so they
  stay in the HUD instead of moving to the cluster, and comes back after they
  close; the status says so meanwhile.
- **Per driver profile**: Show map on and the HUD map size are kept for each
  driver profile, and follow the profile when the driver changes.

## 0.5.7

The map's capture starts at boot after the head unit's media bus is up,
ordered after BMW's own media services and never holding any of them up.
Requires waze-on-cluster 0.8.6.

## 0.5.6

When boot recovery removed a patch because the head unit kept restarting
with it, its Status row reads `Removed — head unit kept restarting`, in the
display language, also with part of the patch left, until its Patch button
applies the patch again. On a head unit that refuses the tool, `Not
supported on this car` comes first. Requires waze-on-cluster 0.8.5.

## 0.5.5

On a HIGH F car where waze-on-cluster 0.8.2 removed the patch at boot, the
update puts it back by itself: the app shows `Status: Patched after
restart`, and the map returns at the next head-unit start or drive.
Requires waze-on-cluster 0.8.4.

## 0.5.4

HIGH F head units are supported again, as every variant is; only a head
unit whose variant cannot be read shows `Not supported on this car`.
Requires waze-on-cluster 0.8.3.

## 0.5.3

Every word on both pages, and the tile's name, in the head unit's display
language: each language the iDrive 7 HMI offers, English where a language
has no translation. A change of the display language shows at once. Values
from the tools (reasons, addresses, numbers) are shown as they are.

## 0.5.2

On a head unit that refuses the tool (HIGH F, or a variant it cannot
read), CarPlay and Android Auto both read `Status: Not supported on this
car`, also while a patch from before is on disk or an apply of it waits
for the next start, which boot recovery turns into a restore; Restart head
unit stays offered while one is needed. Neither Patch button, Zoom out,
Zoom in nor the turn card checkbox is offered there; Remove patch stays.
`Cluster map: Unavailable` while the tool reports itself unsupported, and
the Hide BMW's turn box row is greyed. Requires waze-on-cluster 0.8.2.

## 0.5.1

The main page in three sections under header rows. CarPlay and Android Auto
have the same rows with the same words: `Status: …`, Patch and Remove
patch; Android Auto adds Zoom (`Zoom: 170 dpi`), Zoom out, Zoom in and the
Hide phone's turn card checkbox. General: `Cluster map: …` (the map the
shared render draws for either phone), the Hide BMW's turn box checkbox,
Logs, and Restart head unit with its `Restart: …` row. Info rows read
`Name: Value`; on/off settings are `Hide …` checkboxes; `(after restart)`
marks a value that waits for the next head-unit start. Both Status rows
use one set of words (`Patched`, `Not patched`, `Patching…`, `Patched after
restart`, `Failed`, `Not supported on this car`, …). Rows stay in place and
are greyed when they cannot act; while any change runs, every change in
both sections is greyed. Restart head unit, the last row, shows only while
a change waits for a restart; its row says when it failed, why, and when
the 10-minute limit allows the next. The log lines and the setup line are
off the main page; Start capture is on the Logs page. Restart head unit
asks the Node State Manager for a normal restart. Requires
waze-on-cluster 0.8.1.

## 0.5.0

Android Auto next to CarPlay: a line with its state (patched and its
density, off, pending, not supported on this car, untested aapd build),
Enable Android Auto, Disable Android Auto, Zoom out and Zoom in for the
density, and Hide turn card / Show turn card. Restart head unit also
activates a pending Android Auto change. Requires waze-on-cluster 0.8.0.

## 0.4.4

Hide BMW turn box: a checkbox on the main page. Ticked (the default), BMW's
own CarPlay turn-by-turn box on the cluster stays hidden while the Waze map
shows; unticked, it shows. The choice takes effect at once and is kept
across restarts and updates. While the cluster renderer keeps the box shown
(its mapping guard), the checkbox is greyed and labelled unavailable.
Requires waze-on-cluster 0.7.13.

## 0.4.3

A Logs page: Save logs saves an archive of the tools' logs, the journal
lines they keep and their status, and a phone on the car's Wi-Fi hotspot
downloads the saved archives from the address the page shows, as text and as
a QR code. Requires waze-on-cluster 0.7.11.

## 0.4.1

While CarPlay's stream is live but shows no map, the status says why, from
waze-on-cluster 0.7.2 on: "Stream lost — reconnect CarPlay", or "Stream
lost — restarting CarPlay" where the tool restarts CarPlay itself.

## 0.4.0

The page says to set Instrument cluster > Central display area to Map view:
the Waze map replaces the stock map while CarPlay streams it, and the stock
map is back when the stream ends or freezes. A frozen stream shows "Map
frozen — reconnect CarPlay". Requires waze-on-cluster 0.6.0.

## 0.3.1

The page says to set Instrument cluster > Central display area to Off: with
Map view, Route preview or Assisted Driving View there, the cluster shows its
own content in the centre instead of the map.

## 0.3.0

Installing the app from the Store installs the Waze tool and the cluster
renderer too. The tool writes the CarPlay patch as it installs, without
restarting CarPlay; until the next head-unit start the app shows "Patch
pending — reboot to activate". Enable map appears only when the patch is
off, unknown or out of date, Disable map only when it is on. When the install
leaves CarPlay unpatched (an unknown CarPlay build, or another tool starting
CarPlay), the app says why and offers Enable map. The Store can remove the
app and then the Waze tool, which restores CarPlay.

## 0.2.11

When a patch change waits for the next head-unit start, the app says so and
offers a Restart head unit button. A boot recovery service restores the
original CarPlay binary after repeated failed starts with the patch.

## 0.2.10

The map appears on the cluster by itself when CarPlay streams it and goes
away when the stream stops; there is no Show or Stop button. Disable map
turns the feature off.

## 0.2.9

Enable map sets the area where the phone places its guidance, so Waze's
next-turn banner stays visible between the gauges. Units patched with a
full-frame area are prompted to update.

## 0.2.8

The map is drawn in the cluster's native map area (1088x480), under the
gauges. Units patched at another size are prompted to Enable map again.

## 0.2.7

Enable map applies a single patch configuration, including the size the
phone renders the map at. Units on another panel setting are prompted to
update.

## 0.2.6

Enable map uses a single capture path; the capture mode row is removed.
Capture logs has its own button.

## 0.2.5

The status line reads "Patch state unknown — enable the map" until the patch
daemon reports, so the page opens cleanly.

## 0.2.4

After Enable map, the cluster stream starts with the CarPlay session. A patch
waiting for the next head-unit start reads "Patch pending — …".

## 0.2.3

The diagnostic capture window is up to 5 minutes.

## 0.2.2

Capture mode offers a UDP stream sink.

## 0.2.1

Capture logs: a bounded DLT capture, with its status and an early stop.

## 0.2.0

A capture mode choice for Enable map.

## 0.1.0

First release: a page to apply and revert the CarPlay patch, show and stop
the map on the cluster, and read both tools' logs.
